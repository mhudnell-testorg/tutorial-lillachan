Tonkotsu ramen (豚骨ラーメン) is a ramen dish that originated in Fukuoka[citation needed], Fukuoka Prefecture on the Kyushu island of Japan, and it is a specialty dish in both Fukuoka and Kyushu. It was originally prepared as an affordable fast food for laborers at fish markets. Today, it is renowned for the significant time it can take to properly prepare the dish. The soup broth is based upon pork bones and other ingredients, which is typically boiled for several hours, and the dish is traditionally served with ramen noodles that are hard in the center and topped with sliced pork belly. In Fukuoka, Japan, tonkotsu ramen is referred to as Hakata ramen.
